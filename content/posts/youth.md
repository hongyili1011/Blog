无意间看到《Youth》这首诗，瞬间想到六，七年前有段时间那个在黄家湖畔每天学习英文的少年，其中就有背诵这首诗。


##  原文


Youth is not a time of life—it is a state of mind.  

It is not a matter of red cheeks, red lips and supple knees.  

It is a temper of the will; a quality of the imagination; a vigor(精力) of the emotions.

it is a freshness of the deep springs of life.  

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity,  

of the appetite for adventure over a life of ease.  

This often exists in a man of fifty, more than in a boy of twenty.  

Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years;  

people grow old by deserting their ideals. 

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.  

Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair— 

these are the long, long years that bow the head  and turn the growing spirit back to dust. 

Whether seventy or sixteen, there is in every being’s heart a love of wonder;  

the sweet amazement at the stars and starlike things and thoughts;  

the undaunted challenge of events,  

the unfailing childlike appetite for what comes next,  

and the joy in the game of life. 

You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; 

as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear,  

as young as your hope, as old as your despair. 

In the central place of your heart there is a wireless station.  

So long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, grandeur, courage,  

and power from the earth, from men and from the Infinite—so long are you young. 

When the wires are all down and the central places of your heart are covered with the 

snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, 

then are you grown old, indeed! 
                                                                               –Samuel  Ullman 


## 中文

青春不是年华，而是心境；

青春不是桃面、丹唇、柔膝，

而是深沉的意志，恢宏的想象，炙热的感情；

青春是生命的深泉在涌流。

青春气贯长虹，勇锐盖过怯弱，进取压倒苟安。

如此锐气，二十后生而有之，六旬男子则更多见。

年岁有加，并非垂老，理想丢弃，方堕暮年。

岁月悠悠，衰微只及肌肤；热忱抛却，颓废必致灵魂。

忧烦，惶恐，丧失自信，定使心灵扭曲，意气如灰。

无论年届花甲，抑或二八芳龄，心中皆有生命之欢乐，奇迹之诱惑，孩童般天真久盛不衰。

人人心中皆有一台天线，只要你从天上人间接受美好、希望、欢乐、勇气和力量的信号，你就青春永驻，风华常存。

一旦天线下降，锐气便被冰雪覆盖，玩世不恭、自暴自弃油然而生，即使年方二十，实已垂垂老矣；

然则只要树起天线，捕捉乐观信号，你就有望在八十高龄告别尘寰时仍觉年轻。
